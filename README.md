## Purpose

Build the pairing-plus-particle-hole model Hamiltonian via full configuration interaction theory. Slater determinant basis. Implements DMCPP library (gitlab.msu.edu/daviso53/dmcpp).

## How to run

Run `bash build.bash` to link executable to DMCPP library. You must edit `build.bash` to point to your DMCPP installation path.
